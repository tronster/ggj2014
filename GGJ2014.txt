- Hand icon to place cats [ Shawn ]

- (How to play)


ART:
- Change ending art (sushi looks like "pig" according to some players)
- Shorten width of trailing parts of long dragon dog

- Move death animation up 50 pixels
- Hide last death animation final frame


=========[ TODO ]==============================================================

- How to use a hitbox, per-frame [tronster]
- How to turn off physics on hero and/or bring in animation not tied to physics [tronster]
- How to scale images
	- asset manager with scaleFactor and/or creating textures with scaleFactor as the scale argument to Texture.fromBitmap)


---- DONE: ----
- Fonts? [Shawn]
- Skeleton with shell button on the front [Tronster]
- Make feathers menu sample [Shawn]
- Learn how the particle system works [Shawn]
- Modular input via config files. [Tronster]
- Dissect view; paramter [tronster]
- Learn how to use Box2D for collision detection (via simplecollision sample) [Tronster,Shawn]
	- Use Box2DUtils.CollisionGetOther(sensor,b2PolygonContact)
- Animations at 30 fps while engine at 60 fps.
	// VER 1: use timeScale multiplier
	// VER 2: Example using Spritesheet, animation, frame rate...
	var ta:TextureAtlas = new TextureAtlas(Texture.fromBitmap(new mySpriteSheetBitmap()), XML(new myXML()));
	var se:AnimationSequence = new AnimationSequence(ta, ["walk","idle","hurt"], "idle", fps);
- Animate using SWF [tronster]
	- One .SWF file per entity (hero)
	- Instance name is how it will be referenced (idle, walk)...
	- view:"../sprites/hero.swf"
- Use GIT!
- Starlingize BlittingGameState [Shawn]
- Inventory class
	- Implemented via AGameData (property bag with signals)
- How to make levels

(Not necessary but good to have under the belt)
- Loading screen for dynamic content waiting [Tronster]
- Test out level switching with power-up section between
- AI with push stack
- 2d flat grid layout system
- 2d iso layout system
- 2d hex layout system

- StartlingArt.setLoopAnimations("idle"); // will loop a play anim on hero
- Dragon Bones (free bone tool)
	[Embed(source="../foo/myPieces.png", mimeType="application/octet-stream")]
	private var heroDragon:Class;
	// ...
	factory = new StarlingFactor();
	factory.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onParsed);
	factory.parseData( new heroDragon() );
	// ...in onParsed()...
	var arm:Armature = factory.buildArmature("hero");
	arm.animation.timeScale = 0.75;
	// ...in init, to center properly use offset...
	hero = new Hero("hero", {x:140, y:293, width:66, height:92, offsetX:33, offsetY:46, view:arm});

- Target resolution: 960x640 ( iphone5: 1136x640, alternate: 480x320 )
